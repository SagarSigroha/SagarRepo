Day 5

Today we learned about sprites and sprite sheets. We practiced breaking a single sprite sheet into smaller frames using get() and then displaying them in order to make animations, like a blast animation. We also learned how to control which frame shows using variables and key or mouse events.

For the assignment, I made a character control project using a zombie sprite. I wanted to make a slightly abnormal creature roaming around that we can control. I even added attacks to make it interesting, and for fun, I included a dying zombie animation. It was really exciting to see how sprites and code together can bring characters to life and make an game interaction.
