Day 4 :)

Today we did a quick recap and learned about GitHub Pages, arrays, and images. We also learned how to use nested for loops and the get() function to work with images and create generative patterns. Another new concept was transformations using translate(), rotate(), push(), and pop() which helped us make rotating shapes like flowers with rotational symmetry.

For the assignment, I made a generative pattern using four doodles of monsters. I used an array to load all four images and random() to display them in a grid so that every frame shows a new, changing monster pattern. The mix of loops, arrays, and randomness made it look really fun and different each time like a playful monster wallpaper ;)
