Day 2 â€“

Today we learned about GitHub and how to use it for documentation and publishing our work online. The GitHub part was a little confusing for me.

We also learned about animation and variables ,basically values that can change and be reused to make things move or react on screen.

For the assignment, I had to show a shift from one emotion to another. My main feeling was love, and the new one was disgust. At first, I misunderstood the assignment and made a separate file just for disgust. My idea was to make the love circles turn disgusting by changing the colors to green, yellow, brown shades and add some random movement not organised so it looks like a virus or bacteria throwing germs around...kind of like a big bacteria sneezing tiny germs.To make that effect, I searched online and learned about the random() function and added it to my work. 

Later on , after understanding variables and functions better with if conditionals, I came back to the task and combined both emotions in one interactive piece by moving the mouse, it shifts between love and disgust. It was fun to see how animation and small code changes could completely change the emotion of the artwork.
