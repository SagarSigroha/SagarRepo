Recontexualizing Pong

Chosen “Ism”: Polytheism
(This is my first try and after this I also made Dualism Pong as my final project)

Personal Interpretation 
Polytheism celebrates the coexistence of multiple divine powers, each with distinct traits, desires, and influences. Unlike monotheistic order, polytheism embraces chaos, diversity, and constant transformation... the world shaped not by one will, but by many, each vying for brief dominion. I interpret polytheism as a worldview of shifting balance, where no single force reigns supreme. Harmony is fluid and temporary; meaning is born from interaction, not hierarchy. It is a system of coexistence and conflict a divine dialogue without conclusion.

Modified Pong Rules 
Polytheist Pong removes scoring and introduces a circular arena governed by multiple gods. Every few seconds, a new deity takes control, altering the rules of physics changing the ball’s behavior, speed, gravity, and duplications. Players can “appeal” to the current god for temporary blessings, affecting their paddles or the opponent. Without points or winners, the game becomes an endless divine dance of cause and effect.

This reinterpretation expresses Polytheism by dissolving singular control and objective victory. Instead, power constantly shifts among gods, and players must adapt to divine moods rather than dominate. The game becomes a metaphor for a pluralistic cosmos playful, unpredictable, and eternally in motion.
