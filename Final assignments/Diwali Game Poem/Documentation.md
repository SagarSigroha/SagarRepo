Game Poem Concept Note : Windows of Light

Observations

During Diwali, I was struck by the contrast between brightness and solitude. As lights filled the city, I noticed how each glowing window carried a silent story... families laughing, rituals unfolding, and warm sounds spilling into the street. I recorded these moments: the crackle of crackers, the hum of voices, the soft footsteps of someone walking home alone. What moved me most was how light seemed to bridge distance connecting strangers through a shared sense of warmth and memory.

Game Poem Concept

Windows of Light is an interactive digital poem built with p5.js. The player wanders through a quiet cityscape illuminated by Diwali lights, guided by a flickering diya (lamp). By clicking on glowing windows, the player “awakens” voices and sounds of celebration..fragments of memory echoing through the night. As more windows are lit, the diya grows brighter, symbolizing connection and belonging. When all memories are found, the city fades into lanterns and a final whisper of home.

Experiential Meaning

The game conveys the emotional essence of Diwali through interaction, sound, and light. Instead of competing or winning, the player participates in a reflective act gathering scattered memories. It’s a poem about distance and reunion, turning observation into play, and light into empathy.
