Day 1 – Introduction to p5.js

Today was my first time ever coding, and we got introduced to p5.js. It was really fun because we made emojis in class using simple shapes. I made a heart emoji and was super excited to see it come to life on screen.

For the assignment, my feeling was love, and I had to make an abstract art piece using code. My idea was to show “two bodies, one soul,” so I used soft overlapping circles with gentle colors to represent connection and warmth. It was simple but meaningful, and I really enjoyed experimenting with it.
