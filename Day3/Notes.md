Day 3 :)

Today we learned more about variables and how to use them to create patterns and interactive drawings. We practiced making grids of shapes with loops and learned how to use mouseX and mouseY to make our sketches respond to the mouse. We also learned how to detect mouse clicks on certain areas, like buttons, and trigger actions.

For the assignment, I made an interactive piece where rectangles are drawn across the screen in rows, and their size changes depending on the mouse position. Each rectangle also gets a random color, so the artwork keeps changing and looks lively. When the drawing reaches the edge of the canvas, it starts over from the top.
